# Annotator: a More Complex Add-on #

In this tutorial we'll build an add-on that uses most of the modules in the
addon-kit package.

The add-on is an annotator: it enables the user to select elements of web pages
and enter notes (annotations) associated with them. The annotator stores the
notes. Whenever the user loads a page containing annotated elements these
elements are highlighted, and if the user moves their mouse over an annotated
element its annotation is displayed.

Next we'll give a quick overview of the annotator's design, then go through
the implementation, step by step.

If you want to refer to the complete add-on you can find it under the
`examples` directory.
