# Annotator #

In this tutorial we'll build an add-on that uses most of the modules in the
addon-kit package.

The add-on is an annotator: it enables you to add notes to selected elements
of web pages. The notes are stored, and the next time you load the page they
are displayed.

Let's get started by creating a directory called "annotator". Navigate to it
and type `cfx init`.

Next we'll give a quick overview of the annotator's design, then go through
the implementation, step by step.
