Welcome to the Add-on SDK!

The Add-on SDK is designed to make it easy to develop Firefox add-ons.

It includes:

* a set of **high-level modules** providing JavaScript APIs which you can
use to create add-ons. These modules simplify tasks such as building a user
interface and interacting with the Web, and will help ensure your add-on
continues to work as new versions of the host application are released.

* a set of **tools** for creating, running, testing, and packaging add-ons

The [**Add-on Development**](#guide/addon-development) guide is probably the
best place to start: it's for people who want to use the SDK to to develop
add-ons.

But you're not limited to the high-level APIs. The SDK also includes a
collection of modules which you can use to create your own high-level modules,
extending the SDK APIs. The [**Module
Development**](#guide/module-development) guide explains how to do this.
