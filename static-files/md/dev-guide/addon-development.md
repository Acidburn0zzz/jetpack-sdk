The Add-on Development Guide explains how to use the high level APIs provided
by the SDK to build your own add-ons.

* The [**Tutorial**](#guide/getting-started) explains how to install the SDK,
takes you through the process of writing a simple add-on and introduces some
of the main APIs.

* The **Module Reference** section provides detailed documentation for the
high-level APIs in the SDK.

* The **Programming with the SDK** section includes self-contained guides to
aspects of the SDK which are common across a number of modules, such as the
event model.

* The **Reference** section provides reference material for features which are
not themselves modules, such as the `cfx` tool.

Features and APIs documented in the sections listed above are relatively
stable. We intend to add new APIs and extend existing ones, but will avoid
making incompatible changes to them unless it's absolutely necessary.

There are some features which are potentially useful to add-on developers,
but are not yet stabilised, and which we do expect to change in incompatible
ways in the future. We have documented these features in a separate
**Experimental** section.
