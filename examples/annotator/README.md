This add-on enables users to add notes, or annotations, to Web pages.

Usage
-----

To switch the annotator on, left-click the pencil icon in the Add-on Bar. The
icon should turn yellow: this indicates that the annotator is active. To switch
it off, click it again. Switching it on/off only stops you from entering
annotations: existing annotations are still displayed.

When the annotator is active and the user moves the mouse over a page element
that can be annotated, the annotator highlights that elements by giving it a
yellow background.

If the user clicks on a highlighted element the add-on opens a dialog for the
user to enter the annotation. When the user hits <return> the annotation is
saved.

Elements which have been annotated are displayed with a yellow border: when the
user moves the mouse over one of these elements, the add-on displays the
annotation associated with that element.

To view all annotations in a list, right-click the pencil icon.

It is not possible to delete annotations, or to edit them after creating them.

The add-on is deactivated in private browsing mode, meaning that new annotations
can't be created although existing ones are still shown. On exiting private
browsing the add-on returns to its previous activation state.
