# Add-on Development Made Easy #

Using the Add-on SDK you can create add-ons using standard Web technologies:
JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

The SDK includes:

* A set of modules providing JavaScript APIs which you can
use to create add-ons. These modules simplify tasks such as building a user
interface and interacting with the Web, and will help ensure your add-on
continues to work as new versions of Firefox are released.

* A set of tools for creating, running, testing, and packaging add-ons.

To get started with the SDK, follow the instructions in
[Installation](dev-guide/addon-development/installation.html), then see the
[Tutorials](dev-guide/addon-development/tutorials.html) page to learn how
to create add-ons using the SDK.
