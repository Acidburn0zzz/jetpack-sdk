# High-Level APIs #

Modules in this section implement high-level APIs for
building add-ons:

* creating user interfaces
* interacting with the web
* interacting with the browser

Most of these modules are ["stable"](dev-guide/guides/stability.html),
meaning that they are a fully-supported part of the SDK and we will
avoid making incompatible changes to them unless absolutely necessary.

In the list below, the icons indicate whether the module is compatible
with Firefox for Android, Firefox Desktop, or both.
